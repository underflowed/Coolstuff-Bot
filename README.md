# Coolstuff-Bot
Discord bot I made on my free time for use in coolstuffgames miami discord server.

Was intented to also have challonge support in order to support remote MTG tournaments but was abandoned due to COVID regulations being lifted.

This is mostly being kept as record keeping to see how bad my code was, and how much I can improve :)
